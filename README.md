0x11. C - Print Formatted Data to Standard Output (printf)

Project Description: This assessment sought to emulate printf; a pre-defined function found in the standard library of the C language. The role of printf is to output a string according to a specified format and it operates under the directive of writing a C string pointed to by the format. Using the emulated printf this assessment will tackle tasks related to the conversion of a number of specifiers and sub-specifiers found when dealing with the function printf.

Task 0. Creating a function that prints formatted text

	Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...)
